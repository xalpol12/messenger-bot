To fix:
- [x] split main file-upload component into smaller components
  - [x] image previewer
  - [x] image list
- [x] "delete all" button - with "are you sure?" modal
- [x] form validations div does not display
- [x] rescale selected image preview (max 200 width)
- [ ] figure out a way to add newly uploaded file to the list without reloading the page

To implement:
- [ ] single image details with editing filename, custom-uri and uploaded image 
  - implement thumbnails endpoint on the backend
- [ ] selecting multiple file to deletion in image list view 
- [ ] scheduler
